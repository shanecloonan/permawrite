## What this is

Permawrite is the **reference Rust implementation** of a new layer-1 blockchain (internally codenamed **MoneyFund Network**, MFBN-1 on the wire) that fuses two things which currently exist only in separate chains:

1. **Financial privacy at least as strong as Monero** — confidential amounts, stealth addresses, decoy-based ring signatures with deniable spending, no public address book, no visible balances.
2. **Data permanence at least as strong as Arweave** — content-addressed uploads anchored on-chain with an upfront endowment that funds storage operators forever, audited every block via succinct random-access proofs.

These two halves aren't bolted together. They **share the economics**: the priority fees paid by privacy transactions flow into the same treasury that funds permanent storage. **Financial privacy is what pays for permanent storage.** Every confidential transaction subsidizes the network's promise to keep data alive in perpetuity.

The full vision and the design rationale live in [**docs/OVERVIEW.md**](./docs/OVERVIEW.md). The whitepaper-grade technical spec lives in [**docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Documentation map

Three reading paths depending on what you want:

### 🧭 I want to understand what this is

Start here. Plain-language framing for someone who's smart but doesn't want to read formulas yet.

- [**docs/OVERVIEW.md**](./docs/OVERVIEW.md) — the project, the vision, why it's hard, how it works (intuition only, no math)
- [**docs/PRIVACY_AND_PERMANENCE.md**](./docs/PRIVACY_AND_PERMANENCE.md) — why privacy and permanence are fused here (freedom, incentives, economics)
- [**docs/GLOSSARY.md**](./docs/GLOSSARY.md) — every acronym and term used anywhere in the docs

### 🧮 I want the technical design

Whitepaper-grade specifications. Math, wire formats, hash domains, derivations.

- [**docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — system-wide architecture: layers, data flow, state-transition function
- [**docs/PRIVACY.md**](./docs/PRIVACY.md) — the privacy half: stealth addresses, Pedersen commitments, CLSAG ring signatures, Bulletproof range proofs, decoy selection, the Tier-1/2/3/4 anonymity progression
- [**docs/STORAGE.md**](./docs/STORAGE.md) — the permanence half: chunking, Merkle commitment, SPoRA per-block challenges, endowment math, the PPB-precision yield accumulator
- [**docs/CONSENSUS.md**](./docs/CONSENSUS.md) — the consensus engine: slot-based PoS, stake-weighted VRF leader election, BLS12-381 committee finality, equivocation slashing, liveness slashing
- [**docs/ECONOMICS.md**](./docs/ECONOMICS.md) — hybrid emission, two-sided fee split, treasury settlement, the `E₀ = C₀·(1+i)/(r−i)` permanence derivation

### 🛠 I want to build / contribute

- [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — how to set up, what conventions to follow, how the test gate works
- [**CODEBASE_STATS.md**](./CODEBASE_STATS.md) — auto-generated line counts / file breakdown (regenerate via `node scripts/codebase-stats.mjs`)

- [**docs/ROADMAP.md**](./docs/ROADMAP.md) — what's live, what's next, the tier-by-tier rollout

### 📦 I want a specific crate

Each crate has its own README with public API summary, test counts, and links into the deep-dive docs.

## Status

**Pre-network.** This is the consensus-critical primitive layer plus a working state-transition function. The `mfnd` binary exercises checkpoint persistence, optional JSON genesis (`--genesis`), solo **`step`** (mempool drain + coinbase + produce / apply / save, with **`--blocks N`** and optional **`--checkpoint-each`** for per-block checkpoints), an append-only **`chain.blocks`** log after each applied block (**M2.1.7**) with optional **validated replay vs checkpoint (M2.1.9)**, env-gated validator seeds, and **`serve`** (blocking TCP, one request line per connection: **`get_tip`**, **`submit_tx`**, **`get_block`**, **`get_block_header`**, **`get_mempool`**, **`get_mempool_tx`**, **`remove_mempool_tx`**, **`clear_mempool`**, **`get_checkpoint`**, **`save_checkpoint`** with **JSON-RPC 2.0** response lines — **M2.1.8** — and **`submit_tx`** **`params`** as either an object or a one-element hex array — **M2.1.8.1**); there is no P2P network, multi-method HTTP/WebSocket `rpc` server, or public testnet yet. As of the latest commit:

| Layer                      | Crate           | Tests | State |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | :---: | ----- |
| ed25519 primitives + ZK    | [`mfn-crypto`](./mfn-crypto/README.md)    |  154  | All Tier-1 primitives live: Schnorr, Pedersen, CLSAG, LSAG, Bulletproofs, range proofs, OoM, VRF, gamma decoys, UTXO accumulator, Merkle. **M2.0.15** adds the public `encode_utxo_tree_state` / `decode_utxo_tree_state` codec so the sparse Merkle accumulator can ride inside a `ChainState` checkpoint. |
| BLS12-381 sig aggregation  | [`mfn-bls`](./mfn-bls/README.md)       |   16  | BLS signatures + committee aggregation live; KZG pending. |
| Permanent-storage primitives | [`mfn-storage`](./mfn-storage/README.md) |   44  | SPoRA chunking + Merkle proofs, endowment math, PPB-precision yield accumulator, **storage-proof Merkle root** (M2.0.2), and **M2.0.10 full `StorageCommitment` codec** (`encode_storage_commitment` / `decode_storage_commitment`) for lossless block-wire round-trip of storage-bearing tx outputs. |
| Chain state machine        | [`mfn-consensus`](./mfn-consensus/README.md) |  206  | Confidential txs, coinbase, emission, finality, equivocation slashing, storage-proof verification, endowment-burden enforcement, two-sided treasury settlement, **ring-membership chain guard** (counterfeit-input attack closed), **liveness slashing**, **validator rotation** (burn-on-bond `Register` BLS-authenticated by the operator's voting key, BLS-signed `Unbond`, delayed settlement, per-epoch entry/exit churn caps, slash-to-treasury, mainnet-ready wire format with TS-parity golden vectors for both arms), **full header-binds-body commitment family** (M2.0 validator-set + M2.0.1 slashing + M2.0.2 storage-proof Merkle roots — every block body element is now header-rooted), **M2.0.5 light-header verifier** (`verify_header`), **M2.0.7 light-body verifier** (`verify_block_body`), **M2.0.8 shared `validator_evolution` helpers**, **M2.0.9 round-trippable `BlockHeader` codec**, **M2.0.10 canonical full-block codec** (`encode_transaction` / `decode_transaction`, `encode_block` / `decode_block`, typed `TxDecodeError` / `BlockDecodeError`), **M2.0.15 deterministic `ChainState` checkpoint codec** (`encode_chain_checkpoint` / `decode_chain_checkpoint`, `ChainCheckpoint`, full typed `ChainCheckpointError` family, magic `"MFCC"` + version + integrity-tagged payload), and **M2.0.16 shared `checkpoint_codec`** so `mfn-light` + full-node checkpoints now use one byte-identical source of truth for validators, validator stats, pending unbonds, consensus params, and bonding params. |
| Node-side glue              | [`mfn-node`](./mfn-node/README.md) |  155  | **M2.0.3 `Chain` driver** + **M2.0.4 producer helpers** + **M2.0.5 light-header agreement tests** + **M2.0.12 `Mempool`** + **M2.0.13 storage-anchoring admission** + **M2.0.15 chain-state persistence adapter** + **M2.1.0 `ChainStore` filesystem checkpoint store** + **M2.1.1 `mfnd` binary (`status` / `save` / `run`)** + **M2.1.2 JSON `--genesis` chain spec** + **M2.1.3 `mfnd step`** + **M2.1.4 mempool-aware `step` + `--blocks N`** + **M2.1.5 `--checkpoint-each`** + **M2.1.6 `mfnd serve` (TCP one-line JSON `get_tip` / `submit_tx`, `--rpc-listen`)** + **M2.1.6.1 subprocess TCP tests for `submit_tx` error paths** + **M2.1.7 `chain.blocks` append log + optional genesis `synthetic_decoy_utxos` + signed `submit_tx` over `serve`** + **M2.1.8 JSON-RPC 2.0 response envelope on `serve`** + **M2.1.8.1 `submit_tx` array `params`** + **M2.1.9 `ChainStore::read_block_log_validated`** + **M2.1.10 `serve` `get_block`** + **M2.1.11 `serve` `get_block_header`** + **M2.1.12 `serve` `get_mempool`** + **M2.1.13 `serve` `get_mempool_tx`** + **M2.1.14 `serve` `remove_mempool_tx`** + **M2.1.15 `serve` `clear_mempool`** + **M2.1.16 `serve` `get_checkpoint`** + **M2.1.17 `serve` `save_checkpoint`** (solo-validator produce → `apply` → `remove_mined` → `save`; coinbase includes producer share of drained tx fees per `fee_to_treasury_bps`; optional per-block checkpoint during multi-`step` runs) — chain driver owning `ChainState`, applying blocks sequentially through `apply_block`, a three-stage block-production protocol (`build_proposal` → `vote_on_proposal` → `seal_proposal`) with a `produce_solo_block` one-call convenience, the in-memory transaction pool that bridges `mfn-wallet` to the producer, restart-safe `Chain::checkpoint` / `Chain::encode_checkpoint` / `Chain::from_checkpoint_bytes`, and now a narrow IO boundary that saves/restores canonical checkpoint bytes via `chain.checkpoint`, `chain.checkpoint.bak`, and `chain.checkpoint.tmp`. `Mempool::admit` replicates every per-tx gate `apply_block` runs, including privacy and permanence gates; end-to-end integration tests drive wallet → mempool → producer → chain → light-client flows for both transfers and storage uploads. |
| Light-client follower      | [`mfn-light`](./mfn-light/README.md) |   58  | **M2.0.6 header-chain follower + M2.0.7 body-root verification + M2.0.8 validator-set evolution + M2.0.9 checkpoint serialization + M2.0.10 raw-block-byte sync proof + M2.0.16 shared checkpoint codec import** — `LightChain` tracks a tip pointer + a trusted validator set + the small shadow state needed to evolve that set across rotations. `apply_block(&Block)` verifies linkage, `verify_header`, `verify_block_body`, and validator-set evolution. M2.0.9 adds restartable checkpoints. M2.0.10 proves the P2P-ready path end-to-end: real blocks produced by `mfn-node` are encoded with `encode_block`, decoded from bytes with `decode_block`, and then fed to both `Chain::apply` and `LightChain::apply_block`, reaching identical tips over a 3-block chain. M2.0.16 removes duplicate checkpoint sub-encoders and adds a byte-identity test proving the embedded validator block still matches `mfn_consensus::checkpoint_codec::encode_validator`. The light client now follows the chain indefinitely from a single genesis bootstrap, survives restarts, and can consume canonical raw block bytes. |
| Confidential wallet         | [`mfn-wallet`](./mfn-wallet/README.md) |   42  | **M2.0.11 stealth scanning + transfer-tx construction + M2.0.14 storage-upload construction** — first consumer-facing crate. `Wallet` holds `WalletKeys` (deterministic seed-derivable) + an owned-UTXO map keyed by one-time-address + a key-image reverse index. `ingest_block` scans every output via `indexed_stealth_detect`, decrypts the amount blob with `decrypt_output_amount`, and verifies the Pedersen commitment opens (defeats grinding attacks against the XOR-pad-shaped encrypted-amount layer). `build_transfer` runs greedy largest-first coin selection, samples `select_gamma_decoys` against the chain's UTXO set, and delegates to `sign_transaction`. **M2.0.14 `build_storage_upload`** closes the symmetry: same coin selection + decoy sampling + change handling, but anchors a `StorageCommitment` over `data` in the tx's first output and gates every reason the mempool's M2.0.13 storage admission would refuse the tx — `UploadReplicationOutOfRange`, `UploadUnderfunded { min_fee }`, `UploadEndowmentExceedsU64`, `UploadTreasuryRouteDisabled` — surfaced **before** signing so the wallet never leaks input key images on a doomed upload. Returns the `BuiltCommitment` (Merkle tree + endowment blinding) so the uploader can serve SPoRA chunks later. End-to-end integration tests drive `wallet → Mempool → produce_solo_block → Chain` round-trips for both privacy transfers AND storage uploads; the upload test asserts `state.storage[hash]` is populated after block apply. Pure-Rust, IO-free, WASM-friendly. |
| Canonical wire codec       | `mfn-wire`      |   —   | Planned (currently lives inside `mfn-crypto::codec`). |
| Wallet CLI (`mfn-cli`)     | `mfn-cli`       |   —   | Planned (will wrap `mfn-wallet` with a CLI binary + RPC client). |
| WASM bindings              | `mfn-wasm`      |   —   | Planned (consumed by the [TS reference demo page](https://github.com/shanecloonan/cloonan-group)). |
| **Total** | | **675** | Zero `unsafe`. Zero clippy warnings. Two ignored placeholders/doc examples. |

Detailed module-level porting tracking lives in [`PORTING.md`](./PORTING.md). The phased rollout (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 → Tier 4) and what each tier delivers live in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](./docs/ROADMAP.md).

## How the halves fuse — the economic engine

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/img/money-flow.svg" alt="The Permawrite money flow. Emission mints fresh MFN into the coinbase paid to producers. Privacy transactions pay fees that split 90/10 between the storage treasury and the producer. The treasury drains every block to pay storage operators who submit valid SPoRA proofs. Emission acts as a backstop only when the treasury runs short. Operator and producer income re-enters circulation as users pay fees with this MFN, closing the loop." width="100%">
</p>

Every transaction that touches the chain — financial-only or storage-bearing — leaks **fee revenue into the treasury**. The treasury **funds the per-slot yield owed to storage operators** for keeping data alive. There is no "compute layer" to monetize, no oracle to bribe, no separate DA layer to subsidize: **privacy demand pays for permanence**, full stop.

The full mechanics of `apply_block` are illustrated in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#state-transition-function-apply_block).

## Quick start

```bash
# Install Rust if you haven't: https://rustup.rs
git clone https://github.com/shanecloonan/permawrite
cd permawrite

# Build everything
cargo build --release

# Run the full workspace test suite (675 passing tests, ~6 min on a modern machine)
cargo test --workspace --release

# Lint gate (zero warnings expected)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --release -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

Tested toolchains: `stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `stable-x86_64-apple-darwin`, `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.

> **Windows note.** Use the `*-pc-windows-gnu` toolchain. The MSVC toolchain works but requires Visual Studio Build Tools (`link.exe`); GNU ships its own linker.

## Design philosophy

1. **No `unsafe`.** Enforced at the crate level with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. If a primitive cannot be built safely, we don't ship it.
2. **Constant-time where it matters.** Secret-dependent comparisons use [`subtle`](https://crates.io/crates/subtle). Secret material implements [`zeroize::Zeroize`] on drop.
3. **Audited libraries only.** No hand-rolled curves, no toy SHA. We compose; we don't reinvent. See the [audited-dependency table](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#audited-dependencies) in the architecture doc.
4. **Domain separation everywhere.** Every hash carries an MFBN-1 tag. Adding a new tag is a hard fork by design — no accidental cross-domain collisions.
5. **Reference-implementation parity.** The TypeScript reference in [`cloonan-group/lib/network`](https://github.com/shanecloonan/cloonan-group/tree/main/lib/network) and the Rust code here are byte-for-byte compatible. When they diverge, the test suite catches it.
6. **Production-grade error handling.** No `panic!`/`unwrap` outside of test code. Every fallible operation returns `Result<_, CryptoError>` or the crate-local equivalent.
7. **Determinism is non-negotiable.** Every consensus-critical primitive uses only integer arithmetic, big-endian byte order, and explicit ordering of map/set traversals. The chain MUST replay byte-identically across implementations.

---

## What this is NOT

- **Not audited.** The code is production-*grade* (constant-time, no `unsafe`, proper error handling, comprehensive tests). A real network deployment requires a third-party cryptographic review.
- **Not a re-implementation of an existing chain.** Permawrite's design — endowment-funded permanent storage rewards, OoM-based log-size ring signatures over the full UTXO set, hybrid emission + fee-treasury tokenomics — is novel. The closest two precedents (Monero for privacy, Arweave for permanence) each only solve one half.
- **Not running yet.** This repository contains the primitive layer and the state-transition function. The node daemon and wallet CLI are in the porting queue. See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](./docs/ROADMAP.md).
